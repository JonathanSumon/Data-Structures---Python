# Data-Structures---Python

**What is a Data Structue ?**

It's basically a way of organizing data for efficient use.

**Why Data Structure ?**

-Essential for creating fast and powerful algorithms

-Help to manage and Organize Data

-Make code cleaner and easier to understand

 **Computational Complexity Analysis**

- Time Required by the algorithm to complete execution
- Space Required by the algorithm for computation

**What is Big-O notation ?**

To standardize how much Time/Space is required by a program, Theoretical Scientists came up with Big-O Notation among other things Like Big Theta, Big Omega and so on.

## Big O notation only cares about the worst case Scenario for time and space. It gives an upper bound of the complexity in worst case helping to quantify performance

For Example, Let's say we have a unordered list of numbers (n) and we're searching for number 9. The Worst case scenario would be when 9 is at the end of the list ie the last element of the list. So we have to traverse every single element to reach number 9. 

O(n)

n=The Size of the input

## Given Below are the complexities ordered in from the Smallest to the largest

Constant Time    : O(1)

Logarithmic Time : O(Log(n))

Linear Time      : O(n)

Linearithmic Time: O(nLog(n))

Quadric Time     : O(n^2)

Cubic Time       : O(n^3)

Exponential Time : O(b^n)

Factorial Time   : O(n!)
